# Fortran-to-C
Need help to convert fortan code to C code

I am working on Nvidia CUDA C language. I need C code on which I can perform some test to compare parallel processing capability of C & CUDA C. I am stuck at Fortran code conversion. There are Fortran files in the repository. I have added a script to run all the fortran code through linux.
